    <h2>My work</h2>

    <h3>The New York Times, <span>2017-2020</span></h3>
    <p>The Times brought me on to reimagine what an <a href="https://rd.nytimes.com/">R&D team</a> could look like within a modern newsroom. We explored how emerging technologies can be applied in service of journalism working with companies such as Google, IBM, and Meta to build real-world tools for journalists. Before leaving I started a <a href="https://rd.nytimes.com/projects/working-with-universities-to-experiment-with-spatial-computing">college mentorship program</a> until pivoting during the early pandemic to apply machine learning to aid reporters.</p>

    <h3>Vox.com, 2014-2017</h3>
    <p>I co-founded <a href="https://www.vox.com">Vox.com</a>, drawing the original sketches on a napkin and hand coded the initial site daily. I worked closely with journalists and editors to design and build better storytelling tools including open source applications used by thousands of organizations.</p>
    <blockquote>“The difference is that Vox is open to experimentation, it demands rapid iteration, and it puts technology-shaping people on par with word-shaping people. The difference is that, in many traditional newsrooms, changing the UI on a page &hellip; would have taken multiple meetings where the tech side’s knowledge would likely have been undervalued. It’s a corporate ethos and a permission structure that means good ideas don’t have to get bottled up. It’s being the kind of place that would build Chorus in the first place. That is Vox’s edge, and you can’t buy that off the shelf.” &mdash; <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/04/vox-is-publishing-some-of-its-stories-and-the-interviews-behind-them-in-parallel/">Nieman Lab</a></blockquote>

    <h3>The Washington Post, 2010-2014</h3>
    <p>At the Post, I led the charge to merge technology teams into the newsroom where we rebuilt all platforms with a focus on innovation, including the commercially successful Arc, and Know More, which became the top vertical in three weeks.</p>
