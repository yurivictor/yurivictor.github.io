        <!-- <li><strong>Do great work with great people</strong>: Work on projects worth working on with teams worth working for. Organizations are design documents.</li> -->

          <h3>Ship fast, and iterate faster</h3>

        <li>

          <h3>Small teams get stuff done</h3>

      <h2>Experience</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-large">
    <h3>The Atlantic, <span>Senior Editor</span></h3>
    <p>Started a storytelling team of engineers and designers within the newsroom to work on The Atlantic’s most ambitious reporting, including tracking every migrant child separated, which won a 2023 Pulitzer.</p>


    <h3>The New York Times, <span>Creative Technologist</span></h3>
    <p>The Times brought me on as a contractor to reimagine what an <a href="https://rd.nytimes.com/">R&D team</a> could look like within a modern newsroom. We explored how emerging technologies can be applied in service of journalism working with companies such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/reader-center/magazine-songs-interactive.html">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.newsprovenanceproject.com/">IBM</a>, and Meta to build tools for journalists.</p>
    <p>On my second tour, The Times asked me to quickly build a content mangement system for a new product, but I ended up staying on for another year to create a <a href="https://rd.nytimes.com/projects/working-with-universities-to-experiment-with-spatial-computing">college mentorship program</a> before pivoting during the early pandemic to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-tips-advice.html">apply machine learning to aid reporters</a>.</p>

    <h3>Vox.com, <span>Co-founder</span></h3>
    <p>I co-founded <a href="https://www.vox.com">Vox.com</a>, drawing the original sketches on a napkin and hand coded the initial site daily. I worked closely with journalists to design and build more than 50 tools including open source applications used by thousands of organizations. While there I started and led various teams including data, graphics, tools, and storytelling.</p>
    <blockquote>“The difference is that Vox is open to experimentation, it demands rapid iteration, and it puts technology-shaping people on par with word-shaping people. The difference is that, in many traditional newsrooms, changing the UI on a page &hellip; would have taken multiple meetings where the tech side’s knowledge would likely have been undervalued. It’s a corporate ethos and a permission structure that means good ideas don’t have to get bottled up. It’s being the kind of place that would build Chorus in the first place. That is Vox’s edge, and you can’t buy that off the shelf.” &mdash; <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/04/vox-is-publishing-some-of-its-stories-and-the-interviews-behind-them-in-parallel/">Nieman Lab</a></blockquote>

    <h3>The Washington Post, <span>Director of User Experience</span></h3>
    <p>Rethought all digital systems with a focus on innovation including creating Arc, a highly profitable CMS. I led a team that invented dozens of new products and tools, such as <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jwherrman/memo-it-took-three-weeks-for-the-washington-posts-viral-site">Know More</a>, which became the top vertical in three weeks, our live platforms, which averaged more traffic than the rest of the site combined, and <a href="https://readwrite.com/truth-teller-an-automated-political-fact-checking-app/">an app for fact checking video in real time</a>, which was called “the future of news.”</p>
